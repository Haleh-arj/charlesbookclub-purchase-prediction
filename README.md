Predicting customer book purchases at Charles Book Club using classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and association rule mining.
# Charles Book Club - Purchase Prediction

This project was completed as part of my coursework in Business Analytics and Insights at Humber College.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to predict whether customers would purchase a book based on demographic data and purchase history from Charles Book Club. In addition to classification models, association rule mining was applied to generate product recommendation insights.

## Methods Used

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification Modeling:
  - Decision Tree (CART)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Association Rule Mining (Market Basket Analysis):
  - Apriori Algorithm
  - Support, Confidence, Lift

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, XGBoost, MLxtend)
